"""Prompts and memory of the discrete-command policy.

The RoboDojo counterpart of ``harness/agent/prompts.py`` and
``harness/agent/memory.py``. The benchmark-specific knowledge lives in a *profile* (see
``profiles/robodojo_x5_main.yaml``): coordinate frame conventions, workspace,
camera descriptions, gripper facts and a handful of tips. Nothing in this module
is task specific, and nothing here knows about the simulator: the policy server
renders the prompt from the state dict the agent builds (``main_route.arm_state``)
and the per-command results the simulation client reported.

State schema expected by :func:`state_text`::

    {"steps_used": int, "table_z_cm": float,
     "left":  {"position_cm": [x, y, z],      # fingertip centre, world frame, centimetres
               "approach": [ax, ay, az],       # unit vector the fingers point along
               "finger_axis": [fx, fy, fz],    # unit vector the fingers open/close along
               "opening": float | None,        # measured opening, 0 closed .. 1 open
               "closed_floor": float | None,   # what an empty closed gripper reads
               "held": bool | None},           # opening clearly above the closed floor
